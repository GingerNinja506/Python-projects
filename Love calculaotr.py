#100 days of code challange day 2

# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
#To work out the love score between two people:
#Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
#Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
#Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# And then it's just printing some love calculation strings depending on the score 
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
